Result rendering files
- these are just for rendering a sequence of .stl/.obj files as might be produced by a GNN
- the .blend file contains a simple setup with a light and a camera that is coupled with an 'empty' -- to move the camera, move the empty
- render_*_seq.py files load all files into setup, and apply keyframes so that each is only shown for a frame
- will want to render after baking animation
- the resulting rendered file can be converted to a .gif with the gif_conv file
